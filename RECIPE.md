In bowl, use a whisk to combine milk and sugar until it gets dissolved.  
Stir in some heavy cream and peppermint.  
Turn on an ice cream maker and pour the mixture in. You also need to let it churcn for about 25 min.
During the last 5 minutes of churning, slowly add in some chopped chocolate.  
Finally, transfer the ice cream into an airtight container for at least 2-3 hours before enjoying (if you can wait that long!)
